### Features

- Support Android, IOS.
- This package is used to create a complete customizable and dynamic data table;
- Works fine on any Widget;
- Does not affect the functionality or performance of the application;
- This table has a dynamic sort function which add a sort functionality to the data table and it can sort any type of data in the table and re-arrange the table according to it;


## Demo

### Getting started

####  Install
add this in your pubspec.yaml
`flutter_data_table: ^latest_version`

#### Class

This is the constructor of the class.
```
     FlutterDataTable(
      {required this.columnModel,
        required this.rowsData,
        this.colors,
        this.isCheckBoxMultiSelectAllowed = false,
        this.sort,
        this.padding,
        this.isLoadMoreDataAllowed = true,
        this.onLoadMoreData,
        this.rowHeight,
        this.columnHeight,
        this.verticalController,
        this.noDataWidget,
        this.onSave,
        this.isRefreshAllowed = false,
        this.onRefresh,
        this.onRowSelectBuilder,
        this.tableDecoration,
        this.isSortAllowed = false,
        this.isSerialNumberColumnAllowed = false,
        this.slNoColumnName,
      });
```
### Where:

- **columnModel** is required and it is a **ColumnWidgetModel** type. This is the column model class.
- **rowsData** is also required and it is a list of **RowWidgetModel** type. This is the list of the rows of the table.
- **colors** is a **RowColor** type. To separate 2 adjacent row by 2 different color.
- **isCheckBoxMultiSelectAllowed** is a **boolean** value indicates if multiselect rows allowed with checkbox.
- **sort** is a **Function**. This gives a global sort mechanism for the data table. This is not mandatory as the table has it's own dynamic sort mechanism.
- **padding** is a **EdgeInsetsGeometry** type which gives a padding for the data table.
- **isLoadMoreDataAllowed** is a **double** value. By making this True, data table will get an infinite scroll.
- **onLoadMoreData** is a **Function**. This function will be called when the data table reach the end of the scroll and if **isLoadMoreDataAllowed** is True.
- **rowHeight** is a **double** value. Which gives all the row a fixed height.
- **columnHeight** is a **double** value which gives the headers a fixed height.
- **verticalController** accepts a **ScrollController**. Which is basically the controller of the vertical scroll widget.
- **onSave** is a **Function**. This function has a parameter **List of RowWidgetModel<dynamic>**. This function is been called when this whole Widget is disposed. 
It only gives the List of rows where values are changed by user. The changes can be done by EditText or Dropdown value.
- **isRefreshAllowed** accepts a **boolean**. This flag indicate if pull to refresh is allowed. If this is true then we must provide **onRefresh** function.
- **onRefresh** is a **Function**. This is a async function. This function is called on pull to refresh.
- **tableDecoration** accepts an **BoxDecoration**. With this you can decorate the Container of the table.
- **isSortAllowed** is a **boolean**. This indicates if you want to have sorting mechanism in your table. Sort is done by the table it self. Sort function is very dynamic here.
- **isSerialNumberColumnAllowed** is a **boolean** value. Which indicates if you want to have serial number in the table.
- **slNoColumnName** is a **String** value. This is basically the column name of serial number column. By default it is "Sl No".
- **serialNumColumnWidth** accepts a **double** value. This will allow you to provide the width of Serial number column width.

#### Usageã€€

```Dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:floating_animated_widget/floating_draggable_widget.dart';
void main() {
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(

        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: const MyHomePage(title: 'Flutter Demo Home Page'),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  const MyHomePage({Key? key, required this.title}) : super(key: key);

  final String title;

  @override
  State<MyHomePage> createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  int _counter = 0;

  void _incrementCounter() {
    setState(() {

      _counter++;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {

    return FloatingDraggableWidget(
      child: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(

          title: Text(widget.title),
        ),
        body: Center(

          child: Column(

            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              const Text(
                'You have pushed the button this many times:',
              ),
              Text(
                '$_counter',
                style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline4,
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
      floatingWidget: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: _incrementCounter,
        tooltip: 'Increment',
        child: const Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
      floatingWidgetHeight: 40,
      floatingWidgetWidth: 40,
      dx: 200,
      dy: 300
    );
  }
}

```
### Known Limitations
- Doesn't have functionality of floating on other apps.
- It does not automatically calculate the size of the parent widget it always takes the whole screen to float around.
- It does not automatically calculate the size of the floating widget
